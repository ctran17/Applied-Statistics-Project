# Applied-Statistics-Project
My STAT190: Applied Statistics Project (formerly STAT212), where I performed data analysis and visualization of the hypothesis about the correlation between handedness and memory capability from a research paper.

Tools used:

R (RStudio): Data collection, data analysis, and data visualization including:

- A table summarizing Handedness.
- A bar plot for Handedness.
- A histogram and summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, etc.) for Memory.time.
- A boxplot for Memory.time against Handedness with more detailed analysis (e.g., tapply functions and an ANOVA test).
